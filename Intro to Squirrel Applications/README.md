# Intro to Squirrel Applications

The examples here range from simple to advanced programming.  Each example builds on the skills learned in the previous example. Please note that the first few examples are not power efficient and will drain battery powered devices quickly. They also send data frequently, so you may wish to adjust the reporting interval or use WiFi if working with an imp006.

## The Basics

### [Example 1 - Reading a Sensor](./Ex1%20-%20Reading%20A%20Sensor)

Begin by learning the basics of programming Electric Imp. We will use Electric Imp HTS221 library to take temperature and humidity readings from a sensor. We will also use the Initial State libary to send the data we collect from the sensor to the cloud. This code can be easily configured for use with an imp006 Breakout Board Kit, impExplorer Developer Kit, impAccelerator Battery Powered Sensor Node or impC001 Breakout Board Kit.

## Beginner Applications

### [Example 2 - Simple Refrigerator Monitor](./Ex2%20-%20Simple%20Refrigerator%20Monitor)

In this example we will create an simple refrigerator monitoring application that takes synchronous readings from the temperature/humidity sensor and the internal light sensor. The light reading is used to determine if the refrigerator door is open or closed. The door status, temperature and humidity readings are sent to the cloud using the Initial State webservice. We will use a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) to reference all hardware objects, and to organize our application code we will use a class. This code can be easily configured for use with an imp006 Breakout Board Kit, impExplorer Developer Kit, impAccelerator Battery Powered Sensor Node or impC001 Breakout Board Kit.

### [Example 3 - Simple Remote Monitoring Application](Ex3%20-%20Simple%20Remote%20Monitoring%20Application)

In this example we will create an simple remote monitoring application that takes synchronous readings from multiple sensors and sends them to the cloud using the Initial State webservice. We will use a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) to reference all hardware objects, and to organize our application code we will use a class. This code can be easily configured for use with an imp006 Breakout Board Kit, impExplorer Developer Kit, impAccelerator Battery Powered Sensor Node or impC001 Breakout Board Kit.

## Intermediate Applications

### [Example 4 - Refrigerator Monitor](Ex4%20-%20Refrigerator%20Monitor)

In this example we will create a refrigerator monitoring application that takes an asynchronous reading from the temperature/humidity senor. We will use the internal light senor to determine if the refrigerator door is open. We will conserve power by disconnecting from WiFi or cellular network and taking readings while offline then connecting periodically to send the readings we have collected to the cloud. This code can be easily configured for use with an imp006 Breakout Board Kit, impExplorer Developer Kit, impAccelerator Battery Powered Sensor Node or impC001 Breakout Board Kit.

### [Example 5 - Asynchronous Remote Monitoring Application](Ex5%20-%20Asynchronous%20Remote%20Monitoring%20Application)

In this example we will create a remote monitoring application that takes asynchronous sensor readings using the Promise libary. We will conserve power by disconnecting from WiFi or cellular network and taking readings while offline then connecting periodically to send the readings we have collected. This code can be easily configured for use with an imp006 Breakout Board Kit, impExplorer Developer Kit, impAccelerator Battery Powered Sensor Node or impC001 Breakout Board Kit.

## Advanced Applications

### [Example 6 - Power Efficient Remote Monitoring Application](Ex6%20-%20Power%20Efficient%20Remote%20Monitoring%20Application)

In this example we will create a remote monitoring application that takes asynchronous sensor readings using the Promise libary. We will conserve power by putting the device to sleep between readings and connecting periodically to send the readings we have collected. This code can be easily configured for use with an imp006 Breakout Board Kit, impExplorer Developer Kit (imp001 model only), impAccelerator Battery Powered Sensor Node or impC001 Breakout Board Kit.

### [Example 7 - Remote Monitoring Application with an Interrupt](Ex7%20-%20Remote%20Monitoring%20with%20Interrupt)

In this example we will create a remote monitoring application that takes asynchronous sensor readings using the Promise libary and detects freefall events. We will conserve power by putting the device to sleep between readings. The device will connect periodically to send readings and will also wake and connect if a freefall is detected. This code can be easily configured for use with an imp006 Breakout Board Kit, impExplorer Developer Kit (imp001 model only), impAccelerator Battery Powered Sensor Node or impC001 Breakout Board Kit.

### [Example 8 - Power Efficient Refrigerator Monitor](Ex8%20-%20Power%20Efficient%20Refrigerator%20Monitor)

In this example we will create a refirgerator monitoring application. The application monitors the temperature and humdity of the refrigerator and sends alerts if the temperature or humidity is higher than a set threshold for too long. The application also monitors the refrigerator door using the accelerometer to wake on motion and the internal light sensor to determine the door status. The application saves power by sleeping between readings when the door is closed, and only connecting to the WiFi or cellular network periodically to upload readings or when an alert is triggered. This code can be easily configured for use with an imp006 Breakout Board Kit, impExplorer Developer Kit (imp001 model only), impAccelerator Battery Powered Sensor Node or impC001 Breakout Board Kit.

## Adding Webservices

### [Example 9 - Adding Webservices to Simple Remote Monitoring Application](Ex9%20-%20Adding%20Webservices%20to%20Simple%20Remote%20Monitoring%20Application)

In this example we will use the device code from example 3, but adapt the agent code to send data to an additional webservice, IBM Watson IoT.
